Simple JavaScript REPL for Safari on iPhone/iTouch
by jeremy.ruten@gmail.com

Why:

  iPhone/iTouch has all sorts of great apps that let you draw, make music,
  write notes and create documents, but there are no apps that let you write
  and run programs, or even just mess around with a language. So we must resort
  to writing our programs in Notes, with its humiliating font, with a keyboard
  that places brackets & braces & math operators 3 clicks away, and then we
  cram our programs into Safari's URL textbox via clipboard, as if our lives
  depended on it. No, we just want to code. And in order to do so, we'll brave
  the lousy variable-width font, the cumbersome keyboard, and the popups
  required for input and output. Well, I knew I shouldn't have written this
  section.

Install:

  On an iPhone/iTouch, in Safari, create a bookmark, then copy and paste
  contents of http://github.com/yjerem/eye-repl/raw/master/eye-repl.js into the
  bookmark URL.

Usage:

  Type a unit of JavaScript code into the prompt, and see the result in the
  next prompt. Your command history and results are displayed from bottom to
  top, because the textarea can't scroll to the bottom automatically or
  anything. Oh, type ":exit" to exit, or just click the cancel button on the
  prompt. Oh, and make sure to type ":exit" WITH quotes, or it won't work. Heh,
  just kidding. It actually won't work if you type it like that. Oh, hint: the
  underscore (_) global is always set to the last result that was printed.

Todo:

  - Continued lines
  - Reset
  - Load libraries using AJAX
  - CoffeeScript REPL
